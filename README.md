## Introduction

Common Lisp is known for its flexibility and expressiveness. In this repository, you'll find implementations of various algorithms along with detailed explanations, usage examples, and insights into the inner workings of each algorithm. Whether you're new to Common Lisp or an experienced developer, this repository aims to be a valuable resource for learning and reference.

## Algorithms Included

Currently, the repository includes:

- **Find Primes:** An algorithm for generating prime numbers.
- **Binary Search:** A classic binary search implementation for sorted lists.

## Plans for Future Algorithms

Additional algorithms will be added in the future as the project grows, including:
- Sorting Algorithms (Quick Sort, Merge Sort, etc.)
- Graph Algorithms (DFS, BFS, etc.)
- Mathematical Algorithms (GCD, Fibonacci, etc.)
- More advanced data structures like Trees and Hash Tables.
